## this mapping is for testing the new transform
## here the top level is the function and the next level are the param(s)

#some variables you'll want to replace across the entire data table
# replace:
#   to_replace:
#     true: 'Yes'
#     false: 'No'

#some specific columns will be needed to change. 
#For example, some column names are different across hubs and need to conform to the JDC name
# or, some values are different or more restricted within the JDC so these values will need to be replaced 
#with the JDC values
